# About Me 🧑🏻‍💻

Hi there! I'm Kyle Klus, a free time software developer and a student at the Leibniz University of Hanover, where I'm pursuing a degree in technical computer science🧑‍🎓.

I love programming in various languages such as React, C/C++, Java and Python. When I'm not programming, you can find me in my workshop 🛠️🪚🧵, crafting stuff, woodworking or in general doing DIY projects.

Currently, I work as a part-time frontend developer for the "Finanz Informatik", where I create user-friendly WebParts for Microsoft SharePoint sites. And when I need a break from all that, I like to cook delicious meals for myself and my friends 🥘. 

Whether it's software development, woodworking or cooking, I always strive to do my best and have fun along the way. 

Welcome to my profile! 🎉
